## Welcome to the anatomy of morbidity project
As part of the #hackseq18, we will be analyzing the most recent open dataset called **"Death, causes of death, and life expectancy, 2016"** from [Canadian Vital Statistics](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/180628/dq180628b-eng.htm) for this project.

# Project abstract
With the rise of _aging_ population and _chronic diseases_, Canada suffers from the high costs of disease management. Canadian Vital Statistics has recently released a comprehensive and well-annotated dataset on causes of death and mortality of all Canadians from 2012 until 2016. We hypothesize that understanding the major causes of mortality (i.e. various diseases) among males and females in different age categories across all provinces can inform health care and governmental policies. In this project, we will formulate hypotheses about what we most die of as a nation and test them by exploring these datasets. The overarching aim is to generate a final report on the most common causes of death across Canada that can at its best inform health care professionals and government agencies in developing evidence-base policies.


## Who you are
You are passionate about the scientific inquiry and like to put the scientific method to good use using an interesting dataset. Basic familiarity with data analysis in RStudio is an asset, this includes data wrangling (tidyverse, purr, tidyr, dplyr) data visualization (ggplot2, maptools, ggmap) and data reporting (Rshiny, Rmarkdown). You are concerned about reproducibility in science and so are familiar with Git and Github project management and organization.
