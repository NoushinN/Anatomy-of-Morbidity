Deciphering the Longitudinal Anatomy of Morbidity in Canada
Since 2016, the world has been implementing United Nation's Agenda for Sustainable Development, by addressing urgent global challenges over the next 15 years. 
This mandate is undertaken differently in various countries. In Canada, releasing datasets on life expectancy, death, and causes of death across Canadian provinces across genders and age categories are examples of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global goals for sustainable development. 
The problem with the existing open datasets, however, are that they are too large and the categories are not well defined nor useful for non-data experts. 
Our hypothesis-driven solution enables interactive visualizations with the datasets so that the information are more readily accessible, user-friendly, and interactive.
